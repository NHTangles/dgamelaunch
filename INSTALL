QUICK START INSTALL ON LINUX
============================

This is known to work on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04, but should work elsewhere with
minimal change.


To build:

 ./autogen.sh --with-config-file=/opt/nethack/dgamelaunch.conf --enable-shmem --enable-sqlite
 make


To install (fresh install):

 sudo ./dgl-create-chroot


To update (install new version to an existing chroot):

 # Edit top section of install-to-chroot.sh with local config.
 sudo ./install-to-chroot.sh
